Welcome to Helmutfest! At the end of this winter term, Prof. Helmut Seidl will officially retire.
While he's not likely to stop doing science any time soon, we think it's is a good opportunity to celebrate his achievements and get together all of Helmut’s colleagues, collaborators, and students.

We’d like to invite you to join us for a colloquium and get-together on July 16th-17th, 2026 in Garching with an optional social event on July 18th.
Currently we're planning with a half-day on July 16 (starting after lunch), and a full day on July 17.
